<hr>

### General Introduction: 

"Find Fortune" is a type of non-profit Organization to provide a web site implementation of social services for the needy and low-income families. Charity is an act of kindness, where a person who has financially more than enough of what he or she needs contributes a part of his or her surplus income for the fulfilment of the needs of those who are less capable. The majority of NGOs has experienced difficulties in getting funds, as many charity organisations are making a big effort to collect donations. It is quite costly and inefficient for charity organisations to do on-door envelope distribution and collection. While many people have unwanted things at their homes, they couldnâ€™t donate due to time limitations. Getting donor is a very hard task nowadays so this donation management system will help to find donors easily. Also to help charity organisations to provide better management of their resources and only make necessary door to door collections.

### Problem Statement: 

Many people donate to charity, and many of them make regular donations whether its money, clothes or other items. Also, many charity organisations provide a door to door collection service for donations however this is something businesses are trying to reduce as it is not environmentally friendly. Charities issue bags to houses in certain areas near to them, then they have to make door to door collections in that area and sometimes there is nothing to collect; therefore a website that tells charities where there are available pickups is ideal. By making this project NGOs will get donors easily and Donor can donate few things to needy people just by sitting at home so that we help needy people.

### Objective: 

- The objective of this project is to satisfying the requirements of needy organizations through donations over the net and to help those people who seeks help from others so our project is all about designing a website showing the donation management system, to enable every person/household to donate anything easily.
